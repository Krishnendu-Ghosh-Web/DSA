# DSA
Implemented DSA (Data Structures and Algorithms) in C: Includes functions for key data structures such as arrays, linked lists, stacks, queues, trees, and graphs. Additionally, algorithms like sorting (e.g., bubble sort, insertion sort, merge sort), searching (e.g., linear search, binary search), and graph algorithms (e.g., breadth-first search, depth-first search) are included for efficient data manipulation and retrieval.
